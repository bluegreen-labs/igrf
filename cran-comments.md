Dear CRAN team,

This is an update of the {igrf} package (version 2.0). This package is a wrapper around the public domain International Geomagnetic Reference Field (IGRF, https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/international-geomagnetic-reference-field) Fortran code as maintained by the International Association of Geomagnetism and Aeronomy (IAGA). This update moves the reference field from v13 to v14, tracking the most recent model publication.

Code coverage and all other functionality remains unaltered.

Kind regards,
Koen Hufkens
